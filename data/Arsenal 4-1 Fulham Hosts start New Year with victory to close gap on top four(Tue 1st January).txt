Arsenal returned to winning ways in emphatic style with a 4-1 victory over Fulham on New Year's Day.
Looking to bounce back from a 5-1 drubbing at Liverpool, Arsenal punished Fulham for two missed Ryan Sessegnon chances when Granit Xhaka broke the deadlock (25) at the Emirates.
Alexandre Lacazette then scored Arsenal's second (55) after the break following a fine team move, and though substitute Aboubakar Kamara gave the visitors hope (69), it was only short-lived.
Aaron Ramsey (79) restored the two-goal advantage before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (83) added a somewhat flattering fourth. Arsenal move two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, while Fulham remain 19th in the Premier League table.
It was a tale of three chances in the opening 25 minutes, with Sessegnon firing wide of the far post when one-on-one with Bernd Leno before the 18-year-old then missed a cross completely six yards out.
Xhaka duly punished Sessegnon for those missed opportunities, with the Swiss midfielder controlling Alex Iwobi's cross before stabbing an attempt beyond Sergio Rico for his first Premier League goal from inside the box.
Arsenal could have extended their lead further before the break, but a valiant block from Tim Ream denied Xhaka, while Rico kept out Lacazette's low drive after Aubameyang headed wide.
Lacazette doubled Arsenal's lead 10 minutes into the second half, adding the finishing touch to a quality move which saw Iwobi, Sead Kolasinac and Aubameyang link-up brilliantly down the left.
Fulham got back into it thanks to Kamara - who had been dropped to the bench after his penalty antics against Huddersfield - with the forward coming off the bench to tap in Sessegnon's cross.
Ramsey then came on for Lacazette, and though the tactical switch brought about jeers from the home fans, it was the Wales midfielder who added Arsenal's third from inside the area before Aubameyang saw his heavily-deflected effort sail past Rico to seal the three points.
